# Chimoarg Project Proposal


# __Chimoarg__
******
## Description:
The __Chimoarg__ is an organization focusing on guiding young scholars in their pursuit of: __Chemistry!__ Our __goal__ is to simplify and enhance the understanding of Chemistry material in order to make learning easy and practical. You can _learn_ and _exercise_ different fundamental aspects of Chemistry. Gain insight on mistakes and improvements with our __practice pages__. We hope to make your journey to understanding and mastering Chemistry faster and more convenient.

## Webpage Breakdown:

## Home Page:
> This page introduces our mission and will briefly demonstrate our work. 

## Home Page Extension:
> This page is mainly used to transfer users between our articles. JS will be important here, so as to make this work.

## Topic Page 1:
> This page covers the first topic of Basic Chemistry. An interface containing following topics will be seen on the right, and will help easily transfer quickly between topics. JS will also be used here to link to the other topics.

## Topic Page 2:
> This page is a continuation of the first Topic Page. This page will also include a demonstration of the topic on-hand.

## Topic Page 3:
> This page is another continuation on the first page.

## Practice Page:
> This is where you can experiment and physically understand Chemistry concepts. This can help scholars see how these concepts play into the structure of atoms and such.

## Source Page:
> This is where we lay our foundation in order to avoid plagiarism/copyright infringement.

******
## Others to Note:
> There will be multiple pages of the same type, however the general designs are included. Most of the time, the design of a Topic Page will vary, so as to avoid confusion.

# WAIT, 3RD QTR UPDATE
******
## __Chimoarg Inc__
## Chimoarg is a website made to teach the next batch of scientists the foundations of Chemistry into the next generation of chemists. We focus our work into the meshing the complexity of Chemistry into the convenience of the digital space, and we hope that our efforts will create a better future for Chemistry.

## Features
> Enhanced UI
> Testing Stations (this is where we put the forms in, in the form of practice questions)
> ! The Testing Stations take the input from the user and gives an answer based off of that input.
> Advanced Lessons

## Details
> The website will look significantly simpler, with a cleaner look incorporating modern styles.
> Not everyone can teach without a physical test to wriggle out mistakes. Practice questions and practical chemical manipulation will be used to significantly boost productivity (we will be showing where you made mistakes in a separate webpage).
> Of course, we are not limited to basics; Our lessons will be covering topics and lessons reserved for the best of the best.
